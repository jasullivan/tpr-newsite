                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> In the usual heady rush of TV scheduling, we were contacted at the last minute a few
                            weeks ago – just two weeks before transmission – to promote the thoughtful and provocative documentary Last Whites
                            of the East End (<a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.lambentproductions.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lambent
                                Productions</a>, BBC One, Tuesday 24 May).</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> This revealing documentary looked at contemporary Britain and the impact of
                            immigration on one long-standing community – the East End cockneys. Over the past fifteen years the East End's
                            population has undergone a dramatic transformation and now Newham has reached its tipping point, becoming the place
                            with the lowest white British population of anywhere in the UK.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> Last Whites of the East End explores stories of change in this iconic and rapidly
                            changing London borough. Following the journeys of those people leaving, or staying in a place that no longer feels
                            like home, the film traces the last East Enders who have started to feel 'like foreigners in their own land' as the
                            community their families have lived in for generations changes around them, and their Cockney culture disappears.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The documentary attempts to discover the real reasons why people are leaving, and
                            what perceptions inform those choices. These are the stories of East Enders dealing with rapid change, voicing
                            their honest opinions about what is happening to their culture and communities – and perhaps realising their
                            complicity in the demise of the culture they hold dear.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> But with the European referendum looming at the end of June and immigration at the
                            top of the agenda, the challenge was to create a thoughtful campaign that acknowledged the complexities lying
                            beneath the surface of this story – a portrait of this tight-knit community, and what is driving them to leave.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> For mixed-race bus driver Tony, it is the education on offer for his young daughter,
                            now feeling like a minority in a majority Muslim community that has prompted him to join the exodus in search of
                            belonging. For Usmaan, whose family arrived in Newham in the 1930s from Bangladesh, it feels like a way of life has
                            been lost. The white friends he grew up with have long gone – and he misses them.</p>

                                target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a> invested a lot of time and energy visiting the area and
                            speaking to contributors first-hand resulting in thoughtful features that raised important questions.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The debate on radio and TV was similarly open and informed. On BBC London's Vanessa
                            Feltz Show callers spoke about sweeping changes taking place across the city – from Bromley to Brixton, not just in
                            Newham. Feltz noted that her own grandparents moved from the East End to the suburbs when they were able to.
                            Meanwhile contributor Usmaan – whose family has lived in the East London for five generations – spoke on Eddie
                            Nestor'sDrive Time show about his real concern that the cockney way of life would vanish.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> Inevitably, sensationalist headlines did appear, including the Mail Online's page
                            leader, '<a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3608136/The-racist-programme-honest-reflection-state-nation-Britain-divided-reaction-Whites-East-End.html"
                                target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"The most racist programme I've ever watched"</a>', in stark contrast
                            to the Daily Mail's earlier more considered feature. But this 'scandalisation' prompted closer examination. The
                            veteran media commentator Roy Greenslade inspected the story more closely and, in particular, how it was reported
                            in the Times. <a class="tpr-article-content__link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/26/the-times-runs-a-non-story-about-a-non-existent-bbc-backlash"

                            wrote Greenslade, sparking further debate.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> The 'backlash' turned out to refer to one tweet on twitter and seven complaints to
                            the BBC. Furthermore, the thoughtful media coverage and comments on Twitter far out-weighed negative, knee-jerk
                            reactions.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph"> An astonishing 1.7m people watched the broadcast at 10.45pm on Tuesday night – it's
