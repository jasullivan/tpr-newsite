For over 40 years, they have been celebrating the very best in contemporary food and drink writing, and we’re pleased to say that tpr media has been with the awards for six years.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Alongside the judges, previous Andr&#233; Simon winner and critically acclaimed writer Niki Segnit assessed this year's food books, she won the best food book in 2010 for Flavour Thesaurus, whilst wine expert Dan Jago assessed the drink books – in the end, three of the four prizes were awarded to world renowned chefs, with publisher Hardie Grant scooped two prizes for The Whole Fish Cookbook and Tokyo Stories.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Sydney's ground-breaking seafood chef Josh Niland was the winner of the 2019 Food Award for The Whole Fish Cookbook – a book which reveals an original way to think about all aspects of fish cookery for every skill level. The Whole Fish Cookbook brings an approachability to the idea that fish isn't the smelly, slimy and bony ingredient that strikes fear into all of us, but is rather something that is individual – species to species and piece to piece – each coming with its own characteristics and a method of cookery that suits it best.</p>
