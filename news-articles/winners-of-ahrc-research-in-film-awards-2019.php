The moving and uplifting film features many Haitian artists, from writers to painters, poets to photographers, as they respond to ‘postcolonial disasters,’ such as the 2010 earthquake. We see that the spirit of defiance that led Haiti to becoming the first, and only, black-led republic, lives on in their art.

Three in 1,000 babies in Britain either die or become severely brain-damaged by lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain around the time of birth. However, thanks to the ground-breaking research featured in <a class="blog-link-darkblue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PrZwjDJRLQ&list=PLyIzwe-lwzlb-qZulsCoWdaElQuZ7JJvT&index=10" target="_blank"><strong>The Golden Window</strong></a> – winner of the Mental Health and Wellbeing Award – there is hope for children and their families. The immersive film illustrates what doctors refer to as the 'cooling technique' which takes place during the first 72 hours of a child’s life leaving them in a state of stasis, and with the hope of saving their lives.</p>

Spirit follows Saraswati, the first educated daughter-in-law to marry into the village 20 years ago and wondered how she could ever belong. Ross Harrison and Dr Jane Dyson worked together on the film to reveal that belonging cannot be assumed, but is the slow alchemy of work, friendship, love, loss and belief.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The amazing evening was hosted by writer and broadcaster, Danny Leigh and Jan Dalley, Arts Editor of the Financial Times, who initiated the awards, and chaired the judging panel. A huge congratulations to all the short-listed films, and to all the winners. Can’t wait until next year.</p>
