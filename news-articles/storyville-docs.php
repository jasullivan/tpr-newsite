BBC Storyville consistently provides a window onto the world through its award-winning storytelling and both these documentaries fit the bill. For both campaigns, we will be using both traditional and non-traditional media to promote the films.

The documentary follows the remarkable story of Carne Ross from diplomat to anarchist and his discovery of a new form of politics for these turbulent times. Carne is described by John Le Carré as "a brave and original thinker and a man whose actions speak for his convictions".</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">The film follows Carne's journey to America, Europe and war-torn Syria where anarchist ideas of self-government and
                        equality – above all of women – are being put into practice. The documentary is a compelling guide to the current
                        political crises, but above all an inspiring insight into the practical possibility of a better society. <a class="tpr-article-content__link"

                        international Netflix release in September. This tense psychological thriller tells the true story of the biggest-ever
                        criminal investigation in Iceland's history. In 1974 two men vanished several months apart. The infamous case – which
                        soon became a double murder investigation – shook the country. But the police got nowhere: there were no bodies, no
                        witnesses and no forensic evidence.</p>
                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Then six suspects were arrested and confessed to the murders, many facing long harsh
                            sentences. It seemed like justice had been done, but 40 years later this notorious murder case was reopened when
                            new evidence brought into question everything that had gone before. Using first-person testimony, archive footage,
                            personal diaries, false confessions, dramatic reconstruction and multiple narratives, <a class="tpr-article-content__link"
