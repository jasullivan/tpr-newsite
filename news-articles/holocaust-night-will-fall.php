                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Since late last year, we have been working on a thought-provoking documentary which will be airing tomorrow, 24 January on Channel 4.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Holocaust: Night Will Fall, is a powerful documentary about the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps. With never-before-seen footage from newsreel cameramen who filmed and captured the almost unbelievable scenes encountered there, the film highlights the atrocities that took place 70 years ago.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Holocaust: Night Will Fall increases our knowledge and understanding and offers an important reminder to a new generation.  Sidney Bernstein, then one of Ministry of Information’s leading men, had access to British, Soviet and American footage. He was tasked with creating a powerful and compelling documentary that would provide lasting, undeniable evidence of the Nazis’ unspeakable crimes.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Bernstein's high profile team even included his friend, Alfred Hitchcock as treatment advisor.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Despite initial support from British and US Governments, the film was shelved before its completion as it was considered too sensitive for the rapidly changing political climate. 70 years on, Bernstein’s film has finally been restored by Imperial War Museums.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">It has been a privilege for us at tpr to be a part of this process and to work on something that will touch the lives of future generations.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Holocaust: Night Will Fall reminds us of the immense power of filmmaking and its ability to make a profound impact: possibly one of the most influential films of its kind. After 70 years, we are finally able to see the whole picture.</p>

                        <p class="tpr-article-content__paragraph">Holocaust: Night Will Fall is available on 4OD for a month following TX.</p>
